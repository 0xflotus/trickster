# Supported Origin Types

Trickster currently supports the following Origin Types:

* `prometheus`


### prometheus

Trickster fully supports the [Prometheus HTTP API (v1)](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/). You can explicitly specify `prometheus` as the Origin Type when configuring Trickster, but that is the default when not provided since Trickster was originally exclusively for Prometheus.
